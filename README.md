Such Podcast
===========
1. What is Such Podcast?

Such Podcast is an Android mobile app made by Doge-Driven-Development (3D) that allows
the user to download and listen to their favorite podcast episodes whenever they like.
Simplicity is the prevailing principle behind Such Podcast. Unlike more heavy-handed
and verbose programs, it does what the everyday user needs without any bells or
whistles to get in the way. It downloads new episodes only when instructed to by 
the user. There are no automatic downloads, no login screens, and no myriad of options
for the user to sift through. Such Podcast provides the user with all the features 
necessary for their listening enjoyment without all the extra clutter that other products supply.

2. How does it work?
Such Podcast works by allowing a user to add an RSS feed. After the feed is added, a user can
press a Refresh All button to download the five most recent episodes from all added RSS feeds. Alternatively, they can download the most recent episodes for a single podcast by pressing the Refresh Podcast button. If more than five episodes from a single podcast would be stored on the user's phone, old episodes will be deleted to make room for newer episodes (unless the user chooses to lock the old episodes, preserving them for later).
